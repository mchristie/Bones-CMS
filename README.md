Bones CMS
==========

## Why Bones CMS?

Bones CMS is, as the name may suggest, a bare bones CMS. Fed up with bloated and overcomplicated CMSs, I wanted to create one which was based one an excellent framework (Laravel, of course), but wouldn't get in the way if I wanted to developer some other functionality along side it.

## What can and can't it do?

Multi-site baked into everything, as many tree or blog style content channels as you need (either global or site specific), image gallery with on-the-fly resizing, custom field types (which are very easy to create), widgets, and top-level components.

What can't it do? There's no one-click plugin installation, it's not wordpress nor is it trying to be.
